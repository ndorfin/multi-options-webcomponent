# <multi-options> web component

A progressively-enhanced multi-select / tag-builder UI component

## Principles

- Support an HTTP form POST/GET in a way a server would expect: One or more `name`/`value` pairs.
- Progressively-enhance a well-described and existing list of pairs (`name`/`value`), represented as checkboxes
- Progressively-enhance an extra text field, which would typically contain any new values not already represented by the checkboxes
- Let the developer decide on the markup, as long as they use key attributes
- Let the developer decide on styling.
