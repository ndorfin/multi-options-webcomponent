<h1>&lt;multi-options&gt; Web Component</h1>
<p>
	At its core &lt;multi-options&gt; is a form control helper, designed to wrap around a list of checkboxes and a text field. It then progressively-enhances the containing UI, turning them into a tag-builder, or category field.
</p>
<p>
	Think 'Select2', or 'Chosen' without the depedencies, and using modern web tech.

</ul>
<p>
	It allows a user to: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Add new items (one at a time, or as a comma-separated list of phrases)</li>
	<li>Select from known items</li>
	<li>Get suggestions of matching known items</li>
	<li>Remove previously added items</li>
</ul>
<p>
	It is delivered as a dependency-less Web Component.<br>
	The developer has full control over the HTML and CSS, as long as the developer uses good form markup, and a key set of attributes.
